# Image Gallery
[![.github/workflows/vsce_publish.yml](https://github.com/geriyoco/vscode-image-gallery/actions/workflows/vsce_publish.yml/badge.svg?branch=production)](https://github.com/geriyoco/vscode-image-gallery/actions/workflows/vsce_publish.yml)

A light-weighted extension that brings you the best image browsing experience in VS Code, especially for remote / cloud development.

## Highlights
- **Remote**: Excellent for browsing images on a cloud (e.g. via [SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh))
- **Gallery**: Collapsible grid view of all images in the selected folder, including its sub-folders
- **Performance**: Lazy loading of images (tested on 10k images with a start-up time of 1.5s)
- **Refresh**: Automatically update view as images are modified, added, or deleted
- **Light**: Extension size less than 500 kB, installation time is typically negligible
